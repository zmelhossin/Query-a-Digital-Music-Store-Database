# Query-a-Digital-Music-Store-Database

In this project, you will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the Chinook Database is provided in the files. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.

You will need to follow the instructions on the next three concepts to get the Chinook database up and running on your own machine and check that it is set up correctly. There will be two parts to this project.
## 1-The first part is a series of questions that will assure you have mastered the main concepts taught throughout the SQL lessons.
## 2-The second part is a presentation. Similar to the first project, there isn't a 'right answer' for the second portion of the project. You have the ability to be creative in the questions you ask. You will then write a SQL query to pull the data needed to answer your question successfully. Use the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart, histogram, or another plot) that answers your question.
